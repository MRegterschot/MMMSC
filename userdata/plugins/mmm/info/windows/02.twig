  Every month a style is drawn on $l[https://www.twitch.tv/tarpor]Tarporâ€™s stream$l
  through a sacred ritual. People then have a few
  days to build and submit their maps.

  After everyone submitted their maps there will be
  an event taking place on the Monthly Mini server.
  Here everybody can discover each others
  beautiful creations.

  After a week, the Monthly Mini server will be
  closed and the maps will be added towards the
  main Mini Madness server.
